## Installation ##

You need to have [Java 8 JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed along with [maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

To run the tests locally with Chrome, install ChromeDriver from [here](http://chromedriver.chromium.org), add its location to your system PATH and add webdriver.chrome.driver=path/to/the/driver to your local variables.

To run the tests locally with Firefox, install GeckoDriver from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and add its location to your system PATH.

To install all dependencies, run 

```console
$ mvn clean install
```

## Running tests ##

```console
$ mvn test
```

By default, tests will run on Chrome. To change that, specify `-Dbrowser={browser}` where `{browser}` is either `chrome` or `firefox`. If you haven't added the chrome driver path to your local variables, you can add it directly in the run command with the option `-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=path/to/the/driver`.
